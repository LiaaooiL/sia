##Agricultural Information System
SIA is an open Agricultural Information System.

Its objective is to bring to the agricultural world 3 main things:

1. Information System: A J2EE server to gather, process and offer information.
2. Internet Of the things: An ubiquitous network made with open source sensors and actuators.
3. Extensible Architecture: An infraestructure that allows connect new functionalities

The information system (called SIA) is hosted in this repository. It's a web application created using the stardars of the current J2EE world: Spring, MVC, Maven, jUnit, Hibernate.

The information processed could come from legacy data, input manually or gathered by the IoT network, an offers its services through API build ubiquitous in low-energy systems (Raspberry and Arduino). It’s build in Node.js and hosted in the project SIAREST.

About the extensible architecture, it’s an aspect that covers all the system, everything is designed to attach new components and extend the usability dynamically.
